# mastermem for Claude Code

Team memory for Claude Code: the right memory before the agent makes the mistake, lessons saved when you
correct it. This repository is a Claude Code plugin marketplace with one plugin, `mastermem`.

## Install

In a terminal:

```
claude plugin marketplace add mastermem/mastermem-claude
```

Inside Claude Code: `/plugin install mastermem@mastermem`, then restart Claude Code. The first session opens
mastermem in the browser (or shows the link): approve it and pick the team. The token goes into
`~/.config/mastermem/claude.json` (0600).

Another team or a revoked token: delete that file and start a new session.

## What it does

- Hooks on session start, prompt, tool batch, shell commands (Bash, PowerShell) and Stop send the hook
  event to `<server>/v1/hook/<event>`; the answer adds the matching memories to the agent's context and
  asks for a lesson after a correction.
- The MCP server (`<server>/mcp`, named `mastermem` in Claude Code) gives the agent the memory
  tools.

When the server is down or slow, Claude Code keeps working without memories: every hook gives up after
1 to 3 seconds and never blocks.

## Requirements

Nothing to install: the plugin ships a small helper (`hooks/bin/`, macOS and Linux on Intel and Arm,
Windows 10 and 11) that sends the hook events. The token is kept in the platform's secure credential store
(on Linux `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, mode 0600), never in settings files or `hooks.json`, and the helper
gets it through its environment, so other users on a shared machine cannot see it in the process list.

Build the helper (maintainers): `./build.sh` (needs Go), then commit `plugins/mastermem/hooks/bin/`. Tests:
`cd ../server && go test ./cmd/mastermem-hook` (add `MASTERMEM_PLUGIN_E2E=1` for the end to end run with `claude`).

## Upgrade from srmem

The plugin was called `srmem@srmem` before 0.4.0. Remove it, then install as above:

```
claude plugin uninstall srmem@srmem
claude plugin marketplace remove srmem
```

## Uninstall

```
claude plugin uninstall mastermem@mastermem
claude plugin marketplace remove mastermem
```

Had the older srmem command line client installed (`srmem install --remote`)? Run `srmem uninstall` first, or every hook
fires twice.
